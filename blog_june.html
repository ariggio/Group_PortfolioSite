				<h1>June 15, 2017</h1> <!-- Date of blog posting -->
					<p>Today is the last day to work on our group project. I realized that the "mobile version" wasn't really as good as I left it yesterday, so I spend a good deal of the morning trying to perfect it. I think for the future I'll do my best to follow the "mobile first" model, but I still enjoy having more space to work with.</p>
					<p>I also came to realize that my LinkedIn page is (very) out of date. There are other social media sites and a portfolio site that I currently use to advertise myself, so I've left LinkedIn ignored for a while. Now that I'm revisiting it it'd be great to find a good time to sit down and update it. I already added HTML and CSS to my skill set. Maybe I'll create different sections for "artist" and "web designer/developer."</p>

				<h1>June 14, 2017</h1> <!-- Date of blog posting -->
					<p>Third day to work on our group project. Expanded more on the gallery page and added additional pages for larger image samples. I also did some fine tweaking - very thorough fine tweaking.</p>
					<p>I wasn't very thrilled with my initial font choice for the header and a few other elements, so I went back to see what would fit what I had for the standard paragraph text. In the end I settled for my go-to-that-has-never-let-me-down typeface, "Quicksand." Sure enough it looked great!</p>
					<p>The big thing to work on today was making sure all my available pages were compatible with mobile. I did a desktop-first approach because I wanted to dive into simplistic designing with much more space to work with first, then work my way down. Thankfully there's nothing so far that look (at least very) awkward inbetween desktop and mobile; in fact, this is probably the first time it looked great on the first go. Granted, I did have to do a bunch of tweaking in between thanks to my nitpicking a few spots in between, but I want to say that I did all right. My only complaint would be how the "blog" page looks with a smaller window on desktop, but I'll play around with it eventually.<p>

				<h1>June 13, 2017</h1> <!-- Date of blog posting -->
					<p>This was the second day we worked on our group project. Everything was going all right with me until I decided to add a background image to the home page. My professor managed to find the problem, but then I realized that I didn't like the look after all and changed it completely to be simply a sample image from the capstone project.</p>

				<h1>June 12, 2017</h1> <!-- Date of blog posting -->
					<p>Today was the first day of our group project and I started this series of pages. My main goal was to go with a more simplistic aesthetic so that the webpage's overall design didn't compete with any of the sample images. Personally I'm very biased toward this look; when I eventually create a portfolio site for my artwork (or perhaps incorporate both to display both skill sets), I will definitely look back at the template I'm currently working on.</p>
