					<p>Unless there's something significant that needs to be modified for the sake of this project, I don't think I will be making any more changes to this webpage. While I had the time, I wanted to update the main part of this blog and move the entries from June into their own page, along with modifications to the bar on the left. At least the bar looks more filled now! Very happy as well that the bar itself isn't getting longer. I'll have to keep an eye out for that in the event I need to create more pages for the blog.</p>
